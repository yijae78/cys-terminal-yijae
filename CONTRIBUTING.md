# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in cys-terminal.

## Ground rules

- **Before large PRs, open an issue first** — the project has strong conventions
  (deterministic gates, fail-closed guards, Korean-first docs) and we want to
  align direction before you invest time.
- Match the existing style of the file you touch (comment density, naming, 한국어 주석 유지).
- Every changed line should be traceable to the issue/PR intent (surgical diffs).

## Checks that must pass

```bash
cargo test --bin cysd            # daemon unit tests
cargo check -p cys-app           # desktop app
bash ui/build.sh                 # UI bundle
bash scripts/secret-scan.sh --all  # secret/PII gate (fail-closed)
sh scripts/version-check.sh      # version SOT consistency (release PRs only)
```

## Test isolation — pack sandbox (W0)

Tests must never touch the live pack at `~/.cys/pack`. `cargo test`/`cargo run`
that exercise pack install/update code would otherwise write to the live pack and
can corrupt it. Three structural seals enforce this — you normally do nothing:

- **`.cargo/config.toml [env]`** injects `CYS_PACK_DIR=target/test-pack-sandbox`
  into every `cargo test`/`cargo run`, so even a bare `cargo test` writes to a
  repo-local sandbox, not `~/.cys/pack`. Set your own `CYS_PACK_DIR=$(mktemp -d)`
  to override it per run (honored — `force = false`).
- **fail-closed `pack_dir()`** — in test builds, if no `CYS_PACK_DIR` (or legacy
  `JAVIS_/AITERM_`) is set, `pack_dir()` panics instead of falling back to the live
  path. Tests that manipulate these env vars must use the `EnvGuard` RAII helper
  (restores the previous value on drop, incl. on panic) rather than bare
  `set_var`/`remove_var`, so no "env-is-empty" window is left for a sibling test.
- **positive write authorization** — pack write paths hard-refuse (`Err`) to write
  the live default path unless given a `PackWriteAuth` token, granted only by the
  production entry points (`cys init-pack`, pack-update/downgrade, cysd boot).

Release binaries are unaffected: the sandbox env only exists under cargo, so a
shipped `cys` still resolves `~/.cys/pack` normally.
